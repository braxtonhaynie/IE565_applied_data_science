### Problem statement

Over the past few years, road users' fatalities and severe injuries have risen substantially. According to the United States National Highway Transportation Safety Administration, 36,096 people were killed in transportation crashes in 2019, 38,824 traffic fatalities in 2020, and 42,915 in 2021. Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) is a nationwide census that provides NHTSA, Congress, and the American public yearly data regarding fatal injuries in motor vehicle traffic crashes. The FARS data can be easily downloaded. This dataset includes crashes in which at least one person died. First, get observations in which more than one person was riding in the vehicle involved in a fatal-injury crash. Then, explainable machine learning methods will be used to quantify contributing factors in the survival time of the person who died (if the person died instantly or within 30 days after the crash)
